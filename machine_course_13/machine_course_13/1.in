To be or not to be, that is a question.
Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of the outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them.
To die, to sleep, no more. 
And by a sleep to say the end of a thousand natural shocks and heartaches that our blesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation.
